# Recitation Exercise \#5

In this recitation exercise, you'll explore the computational complexity of dynamic array insertion.  You can compile this code using the provided makefile:
```
make
```

There's also a little script included that will use Gnuplot to plot a TSV file as a line graph.  This script may come in handy to help analyze some of the timing information you generate in this exercise.  You can run the script like this, passing the input TSV file as the first command-line argument and the output JPEG file as the second command-line argument:
```
./generate_plot_from_tsv input.tsv output.jpg
```

Note that the plotting script assumes that [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is installed and available on your machine.  It should already be installed on the ENGR servers, if you're working there.
